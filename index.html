		<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>	My name is Madysen Rideoutte and I am a sophomore at the University of South Carolina.
			I am originally from Columbia SC, so I have many family members close by which is one of the
			things I love about going to school here. I moved to Myrtle Beach when I was seven and have loved
			growing up close to the beach and spending most of my free time there in the summer. I have a twin
			sister that also goes to the University of South Carolina and we have three dogs at home. We do not
			live in the same apartment at school but do see each other about once a week. <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
			<br>	Being originally from Columbia, I grew up a gamecock fan and have loved everything about being at Carolina. My favorite thing
			about going to school here is the campus, it is beautiful and I love showing my gamecock pride during football season! I am a
			biology major, however I enjoy chemistry and math over my biology classes. Being a biology major is very time consuming but
			I enjoy my classes and could not imagine having a different major. However, I am excited about my schedule next semester because
			it is a slightly smaller course load, which I hope will give me time to prioritize each class. </span></p>

		<h3> My Future Career Plans </h3>
					<p>	My future career plans are to go to PA school after graduation,
					however preparation to do so starts now. To apply for PA school I need 1500+ hours 
					of patient care which I plan to start obtaining my junior year. Along with that I have to
					get volunteer hours which I plan to do at Prisma Health in Columbia. I also plan to shadow
					at least two PAs sometime soon to see what a general work day looks like.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more2">
				I decided PA school was what I wanted to do because I have loved being around children growing up,
				so I hope to specialize in pediatrics. I plan to apply to many schools to better my chances of getting in
				since it is a highly competitive program. I plan to apply to schools in South Carolina, North Carolina, 
				and Florida. After finishing PA school I will look for jobs in South Carolina as well as North Carolina 
				because I want to be somewhat close to home. </span></p>
